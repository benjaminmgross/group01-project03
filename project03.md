# Project 2: Classification

**Your project will demonstrate your ability to:**

* Understand, explain and utilize the supervised learning classification framework
* Determine and refine meaningful classification challenges
* Identify appropriate features, labels and classification algorithms
* Create and train a classifier and adjust features to improve accuracy
* Develop a basic report to explain your process, data and results

**Due Date and Requirements**

*   Projects will be due Aug 5th.

    *   You'll be presenting your projects in small groups on that class day, so come prepared
    *   Expect to see all projects turned in before the beginning of class
    *   If you get it to us earlier, we will try to provide early feedback

**Project Requirements**

* Determine your algorithm and explain why you chose it (in the context of other models if you looked at multiple models).
* Produce code for classification and feature improvement, including accuracy rates and feature details.
* Prepare a short presentation that covers the points above (slides or an iPython Notebook)

**You will Submit**
* All code
* Your presentation

**Lesson material in order to complete Project**

*   Python Basics and Using Libraries/Modules
*   Data visualization
*   Exploratory Data Analysis
*   Intro to Machine Learning
*   Logistic Regression
*   Naive Bayes
*   KNN
*   Decision Trees
